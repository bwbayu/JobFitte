                                                underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised
                                                nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. There are two
                                                fangs visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides
                                                sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing.
                                                A single wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard arms are short
                                                and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. It has stocky legs with
                                                cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a
                                                sizable flame. As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain
                                                thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward
                                                from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve
                                                slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like
                                                spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane,
                                                and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned
                                                with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the f
                                                lame on its tail now burns blue. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense
                                                flames. Gallery tab content Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pok√©mon. It is primarily orange with a
